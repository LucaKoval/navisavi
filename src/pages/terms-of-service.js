              You will need to register by creating an account (i.e. become a

            <p>
              When you register, you will select (or we will issue to you) a

              your behalf. You acknowledge and understand that Navi Savi relies
              on User IDs to distinguish Members from other users. If someone
              accesses our Platform using your User ID, we will rely on that
              User ID and will assume that you or your representative is
              accessing the Platform. No one except the user that originally
              created a User ID is authorized to access the Platform using that
              User ID, even if that person shares his or her registration
              information or other credentials with another person. You are
              solely responsible for any and all access to the Platform or use
              of the Service by other persons using your User ID. Please notify
              us immediately if you become aware that your User ID is being used
              without authorization.

          that you purchase through the Platform, unless you remove the Payment
          Information from your profile. If all or part of your payment cannot
          be processed using the Payment Information you provide for a given
          Transaction, we will submit an invoice to you. In that case, you: ●

          another person, and that you will not use a password on Navi Savi that
          you have used on another website. 7. PRIVACY We believe that personal
          privacy issues are important, so we developed a Privacy Notice to
          explain how we collect, use and disclose information and Content. The
          Privacy Notice forms part of our agreement with you and is
          incorporated in these Terms of Use by reference. For full details,

          parties. They are responsible for all aspects of order processing,
          fulfillment, billing and customer service related to the products and
          services they offer. We are not a party to any transactions entered
