          types and versions, operating system and platform, and other
          technology on the devices you use to access the Platform. If you
          access the Platform through different devices (e.g., your mobile phone
          or personal computer), the information that we collect and store
          through those different uses may be cross-referenced and combined, and
          your contributions from any of those devices or platforms will become
          part of the Platform. 3.1.6 Profile Data, with respect to a Member or
          a pseudonymous user, includes all of your personal data which is
          attributable to that Member or pseudonymous user. If you write reviews

          contributions you like, where you check-in or where your friends
          check-in on your behalf, which contributions or users you follow, and

          or indirectly reveal your identity. For example, we may aggregate your
          Usage Data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific
          website feature. However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data
          with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify

          accordance with this Privacy Notice. 3.4. Special Categories of

        </p>

          A cookie is a small text file of letters and numbers that we store in
          your browser or on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device.

        <p>
          A web beacon (also referred to as a clear gif, pixel tag, or
          single-pixel gif) is a small electronic file that permits us, for
          example, to count users who have visited our website or opened an
          email and for other related website statistics (for example, recording
          the popularity of certain website content and verifying system and
          server integrity).&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>We use the following types of cookies:&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          4.4.1 Strictly necessary cookies. These cookies are required for the
          operation of our Platform. Our users cannot opt into or out of these
          cookies. 4.4.2 Analytical/performance cookies. These cookies allow us
          to recognize and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors
          move around our Platform when they are using it. This helps us to
          improve the way our Platform works, for example, by ensuring that
          users are finding what they are looking for easily. We will place
          these cookies unless our users have opted out. 4.4.3 Functionality
          cookies. These cookies are used to recognize you when you return to
          our Platform. This enables us to personalize our content for you and
          remember your preferences. We will place these cookies unless our
          users have opted out. 4.4.4 Targeting cookies. These cookies record
          your visit to our Platform, the pages you have visited and the links
          you have followed. We will use this information to make our Platform,

        <p>
          California law requires us to disclose how we respond to web browser
          Do Not Track (DNT) signals. Because there is no industry or legal
          standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, the Platform does
          not treat users that transmit a DNT signal differently than those
          users that do not.&nbsp;

          your Profile Data to form a view on what we think you may want or
          need, or what may be of interest to you. Where this information is
          collected pseudonymously, we may use pseudonymous information to
          advertise or share with others so they may advertise tailored products

          purpose. We will use your personal data only for the purposes for

          original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the
          processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original

          the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.&nbsp;
        </p>

          requirements, court orders, or investigations. We may also receive
          personal data from these parties. We require all third parties with
          whom we contract to respect the security of your personal data and to
          treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party
          service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes

          process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance
          with our instructions.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          7. DATA SECURITY We have put in place appropriate security measures to
          prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or
          accessed in an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we
          limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents,
          contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know.
          They will only process your personal data on our instructions, and
          they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal
          data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a
          breach where we are legally required to do so.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          8. DATA RETENTION We will retain your personal data only for as long
          as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for,
          including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax,
          accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data
          for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably
          believe there is a prospect of litigation with respect to our
          relationship with you. To determine the appropriate retention period
          for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of
          the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or
          disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process
          your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through
          other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or
          other requirements. In some circumstances, we will anonymize your
          personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for
          research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this
          information indefinitely without further notice to you.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          9. DATA ACCESS 9.1. Your Rights. Under certain circumstances, you have
          rights under the data protection laws in relation to your personal
          data. Such rights may include the right to: ● Request access to your
          personal data. ● Request deletion of your personal data. ● Correct
          your personal data. ● Object to the processing of your personal data.
          ● Request that your personal data be transferred to another person. ●

          supervisory authority in the event we violate applicable data
          protection laws.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          9.2. No fee normally required. You will not have to pay a fee to
          access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights).
          However, we may (a) charge a reasonable fee, or (b) refuse to comply
          with your request, if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or

        </p>
        <p>9.3. What we may need from you.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          We may need to request specific information from you to help us
          confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal
          data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security
          measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person
          who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for
          further information in relation to your request to speed up our
          response.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          9.4. Time limit to respond. We try to respond to all legitimate
          requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a
          month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a
          number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you
          updated.&nbsp;

          as provided below, by visiting www.navisaviapp.com/optout with the

          extent that you provide it to the general public. 4.2. Access to
          Specific Information and Data Portability Rights. You have the right
          to request that we disclose certain information to you about our
          collection and use of your personal information over the past 12
          months. If we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request
          (see Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights), we

          information categories that each category of recipient obtained. 4.3.
          Deletion Request Rights. You have the right to request that we delete
          any of your personal information that we collected from you and
          retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm
          your verifiable consumer request (see Exercising Access, Data
          Portability, and Deletion Rights below), we will delete (and direct
          our service providers to delete) your personal information from our
          records, unless an exception applies. We may deny your deletion
          request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our
          service provider(s) to: ● Complete the transaction for which we
          collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you
          requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of
          our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our

          those responsible for such activities. ● Debug products to identify

          reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your
          relationship with us. ● Comply with a legal obligation. ● Make other
          internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with
          the context in which you provided it. 4.4. Exercising Access, Data
          Portability, and Deletion Rights. To exercise the access, data
          portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a
          verifiable consumer request to us using the contact information below.
          Only you, or a person registered with the California or Nevada
          Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make
          a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information.
          You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your
          minor child. You may only make a verifiable consumer request for&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The
          verifiable consumer request must: ● Provide sufficient information
          that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom
          we’ve collected personal information or an authorized representative.
          ● Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to
          properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. We cannot respond to
          your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot
          verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the
          personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer
          request does not require you to create an account with us. We will
          only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer
          request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the
          request. 4.5. Response Timing and Format. We endeavor to respond to a
          verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its
          receipt. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and
          extension period in writing. We will deliver our written response by
          mail or electronically, at your option. Any disclosures we provide
          will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer
          request’s receipt. The response we provide will also explain the
          reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data
          portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal
          information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit
          the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.
          We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable
          consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly
          unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will
          tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost
          estimate before completing your request.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          5. NON-DISCRIMINATION We will not discriminate against you for
          exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we
          will not: ● Deny you goods or services. ● Charge you different prices
          or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts
          or other benefits, or imposing penalties. ● Provide you a different
          level or quality of goods or services. ● Suggest that you may receive
          a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level
          or quality of goods or services.&nbsp;
        </p>
