              for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax,

            <p>
              To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data,
              we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal
              data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or
              disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we
              process your personal data and whether we can achieve those

              <p>
                To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights
                described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to
                us using the contact information below.
              </p>
              <p>
                Only you, or a person registered with the California or Nevada
                Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may
                make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal
                information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on
                behalf of your minor child. You may only make a verifiable
                consumer request for access or data portability twice within a
                12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:

              <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
                <li>
                  Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably
                  verify you are the person about whom we’ve collected personal
                  information or an authorized representative.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to

              </ul>
              <p>
                We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal
                information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to
                make the request and confirm the personal information relates to
                you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you
                to create an account with us. We will only use personal
                information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify
                the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.

              <p className="sub-list">4.5. Response Timing and Format. </p>
              <p>
                We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within
                forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time, we
                will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.
                We will deliver our written response by mail or electronically,
                at your option.
              </p>
              <p>
                Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period
                preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. The
                response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot
                comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability
                requests, we will select a format to provide your personal
                information that is readily useable and should allow you to
                transmit the information from one entity to another entity
                without hindrance.
              </p>
              <p>
                We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable
                consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or
                manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants
                a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide
                you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
